# Build the libraries for both hard and soft floating point
# This specifies the possible RISC-V multilib names, along with the directory
# structures that will be created.  MULTILIB_OPTIONS defines which flags can be
# passed, with options seperated by a "/" being mutually exclusive.  GCC's
# build infastructure will append no flag as one of the targets, which is why
# MULTILIB_REQUIRED is defined.  The directory names line up with the various
# options, ignoring space vs slash distinctions.  The full directory name for a
# multilib is a slash-joined string of every present option, with the DIRNAME
# being the directory inside GCC (for libgcc and friends) and the OSDIRNAME
# setting the default library search path for the linker.  OSDIRNAME starts
# relative to lib, which is why there's a ".." before some of them.  As an
# example, one of the generated multilibs will be:
#  CFLAGS:    -march=rv32imafd -mabi=ilp32d
#  DIRNAME:   GCC_HOME/rv32imafd/ilp32d
#  OSDIRNAME: /lib32/ilp32d

# multilib", but I don't want to also go and build a libc for them so instead I
# inform GCC that G ISAs are actually IMAFD.
